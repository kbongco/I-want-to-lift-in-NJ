          Just a girl trying to find a place to lift, and also trying to have
          something on her programming portfolio. I made this just for fun and I
          also realize this may or may not be a complete list/location finder of
          all the powerlifting/weightlifting friendly gym in NJ. If you have a
          location that I may have missed, please contact me and I'll add it
          accordingly.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Also, this is technically a "mobile" app, so please view on your
          various mobile devices for the best/optimized quality
        </p>
      </div>
