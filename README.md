# I want 2 lift in NJ 
An app that helps find the locations of powerlifting, weightlifting, and strongman friendly gyms in the state of NJ. 

# Inspiration 
I'm often on social media a lot, specifically instagram. I follow a lot of lifters in NJ for inspiration, on one particular day, someone I was following on social media was complaining about training at a commercial gym, so think Planet Fitness, Retro Fitness, 24hr Fitness, etc. Due to the lack of equipment at that gym. Thus, the idea of "I want 2 lift in NJ" was born! 

# Coding Languages/Libraries
This is only a front end "mobile app" web application. This was built in the following libraries and languages.
React.js
React-BootStrap
React-MapBox GL 
Yelp API

# Current Features/Work in Progress
- Trying to figure out how to show current location instead of starting off in the set location in the code. 
- Planning on converting into a React Native App in the future
- Planning on adding locations outside of NJ probably will expand to NY and tri-state. 

# Where can I view this site? 

Please view on mobile since this is designed to me more of a mobile app as opposed to a desktop app.
